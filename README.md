# chrome-converter

This branch converts all text on page from Heiltsuk Duolos to Unicode. It also converts all a's to 7's just to make the changes more obvious. To initiate the conversion you must click the icon.

This should be combined with the master branch by converting only highlighted text if there is highlighted text.

It should also have a dropdown menu to select what conversion (Heiltsuk Duolos/Heiltsuk Times or Chilcotin)
