# chrome-converter

Currently the project takes a highlighted phrase from any tab where the extension is running, and prints that phrase in a new tab when the extension button is pressed.

The next task is to encode the highighted phrase as a unicode code ('\u0301' for example) before printing it to the page.  I think I need to import some kind of module or piece of javascript to achieve this.
